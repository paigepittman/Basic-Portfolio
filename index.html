			<p> I'm a 26 year old LA native learning to code. After recieving my Bachelor's Degree in English from CSUN, I worked in retail management for Abercrombie and Fitch, running some of the company's highest volume locations. In January of 2017 I left A&F to pursue a more creative field. I spent some time working in film production and came across the UCLA Coding Bootcamp program, where I started coding. In my spare time I go to raves and hang out with my little matese shitzu named Thumper.
